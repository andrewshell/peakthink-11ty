Welcome to Peak Think, a resource for software developers seeking to unlock their full potential.

I've been a professional software developer for 20 years, and I still struggle regularly to stay productive and on top of things. This website is where I write little reminders of the strategies that work for me when I remember to do them.

Hopefully, you'll find them helpful in overcoming your challenges.
